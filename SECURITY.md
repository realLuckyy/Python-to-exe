## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### ?? Private Reporting

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com] 
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers through secure channels

### ?? What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: OS version, .NET version, Python version
- **Proposed Fix**: If you have suggestions for remediation

### ?? Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **Initial Response**: 48 hours
- **Assessment**: 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and users have time to update

### ??? Security Considerations

#### Application Security
- **Process Execution**: The application executes Python and PyInstaller processes
- **File System Access**: Reads Python files and writes executable outputs
- **Network Access**: Downloads PyInstaller packages when needed
- **Registry Access**: May access Windows registry for Python detection

#### Potential Risk Areas
1. **Code Injection**: Malicious Python scripts could potentially harm the system
2. **File Path Traversal**: Improper file path handling
3. **Process Hijacking**: Malicious processes masquerading as Python/PyInstaller
4. **Network Security**: Package downloads over insecure connections

#### Mitigation Measures
- **Input Validation**: All file paths and user inputs are validated
- **Process Security**: Direct executable paths used when possible
- **Sandboxing**: Conversion processes run with limited privileges
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information disclosure

### ?? Security Best Practices for Users

#### Safe Usage
1. **Scan Python Files**: Ensure Python scripts are from trusted sources
2. **Run as Standard User**: Don't run as Administrator unless necessary
3. **Antivirus**: Keep antivirus software updated
4. **Firewall**: Monitor network connections during PyInstaller downloads

#### Generated Executables
1. **Code Signing**: Consider signing generated executables for distribution
2. **Antivirus Scanning**: Scan generated executables before distribution
3. **Testing**: Test executables in isolated environments first

### ?? Known Security Considerations

#### PyInstaller Security
- Generated executables can be reverse-engineered
- Python source code is embedded (though compiled to bytecode)
- Dependencies are bundled and visible
- No built-in obfuscation or encryption

#### Windows Security
- Windows Defender may flag generated executables as potentially unwanted
- Some antivirus software may quarantine or block executables
- Digital signatures improve trust and reduce false positives

### ?? Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- **Prioritized**: Released as soon as possible
- **Documented**: Clearly described in release notes
- **Communicated**: Announced through appropriate channels
- **Backward Compatible**: When possible, to ease adoption

### ?? Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Team**: [security@yourproject.com]
- **Maintainer**: [maintainer@yourproject.com]
- **GitHub**: Use private vulnerability reporting

### ?? Security Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers and users who help improve our security:

- **Responsible Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices
- **Recognition**: Security contributors will be acknowledged (with permission)
- **Coordination**: We work with researchers to coordinate disclosure
