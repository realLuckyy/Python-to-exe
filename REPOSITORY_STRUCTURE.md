## ??? Architecture Components

### Core Application (`PyConverter/`)
- **Form1.cs**: Main application logic and UI event handling
- **Form1.Designer.cs**: Auto-generated UI layout code
- **Program.cs**: Application entry point and initialization

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Python Environment Detection**
   - Multiple Python installation discovery methods
   - Direct executable path resolution
   - Environment validation and diagnostics

2. **PyInstaller Management**
   - Automatic installation capabilities
   - Multiple fallback installation methods
   - Direct executable usage when available

3. **User Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop support for Python files
   - Real-time conversion progress and logging
   - Comprehensive error reporting and guidance

4. **Process Management**
   - Async process execution
   - Proper process cleanup and cancellation
   - Resource management

## ?? File Responsibilities

### Core Files
| File | Purpose | Maintainer Focus |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `Form1.cs` | Main application logic | Core functionality, UI events |
| `Form1.Designer.cs` | UI layout | Visual design, control placement |
| `Program.cs` | App initialization | Startup logic, global settings |

### Documentation Files
| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `README.md` | User documentation | With each major release |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Problem resolution | As issues are discovered |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history | With each release |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Developer guide | As needed for process changes |

### Automation Files
| File | Purpose | Maintenance |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | CI/CD pipeline | As build process changes |
| `build-release.bat` | Local release builds | Keep in sync with CI/CD |
| `check_python_setup.bat` | Environment diagnostics | Update with new Python versions |

## ?? Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for new features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes for production

### Release Process
1. Development on feature branches
2. Merge to develop for integration testing
3. Create release branch from develop
4. Final testing and bug fixes
5. Merge to main and tag release
6. GitHub Actions builds and publishes release

## ?? Contribution Areas

### High Impact Areas
- **Error Handling**: Improve user experience during failures
- **Python Detection**: Support for more Python installations
- **Performance**: Optimize conversion speed and resource usage
